INTEGRATION TESTS

The driver is completely "out-of-system" and thus awkward sh scripts. 
Most of the work should be done in-system and through configuration and data variations.  The
test driver should do little more than set it up and validate it completed.  For more traditional
tests, see the unit/functional test.
